## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a key application of machine learning in the real estate sector. This project utilizes data-driven approaches to understand and predict house prices based on multiple factors.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a variety of features related to houses and their prices. It comprises both numerical and categorical variables, providing a comprehensive view of the properties.

## Features

The dataset contains the following types of features:

- **Numerical Features**: Continuous variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
- **Categorical Features**: Non-numerical variables such as neighborhood, house type, etc.
- **Year Features**: Features related to the year built, year sold, etc.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigating the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Using techniques such as Lasso regression to identify the most impactful features.
